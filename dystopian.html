		<p> "The Hunger Games," Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old girl from District 12 in the dystopian nation of Panem, volunteers to participate in the Hunger Games in place of her younger sister, Prim. The Games are a televised event where young people, known as tributes, are forced to fight to the death in an arena, and Katniss and Peeta, the other tribute from District 12, must navigate the challenges and violence to survive. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a stunning performnace again, securing this film 4.8 stars.

		<p> Thomas, a teenager, arrives in a glade at the center of a giant labyrinth. Like the other youths dumped there before him, he has no memory of his previous life. Thomas quickly becomes part of the group and soon after demonstrates a unique perspective that scores him a promotion to Runner status -- those who patrol the always-changing maze to find an escape route. Together with Teresa, Thomas tries to convince his cohorts that he knows a way out. Despite the characters' struggles, the silly film and bad acting is worthy of 4 stars.

		<p> After a deadly earthquake destroys his home in Peruvian rainforest, a young bear (Ben Whishaw) makes his way to England in search of a new home. The bear, dubbed "Paddington" for the london train station, finds shelter with the family of Henry (Hugh Bonneville) and Mary Brown (Sally Hawkins). Although Paddington's amazement at urban living soon endears him to the Browns, someone else has her eye on him: Taxidermist Millicent Clyde (Nicole Kidman) has designs on the rare bear and his hide. Considering how iconic it is, i couldnt rate it less than 4.5 stars!</p>

		<p> Don’t Look Up follows two scientists, Kate Dibiasky, a Ph.D. candidate, and Dr. Randall Mindy, in their discovery of a comet that is on its way to strike the planet Earth and cause an extinction-level event, much like the extinction of the dinosaurs. Dibiasky and Mindy then undergo a long journey to inform the public about their discovery, all while President Orlean begins a campaign titled #Don’tLookUp in order to discourage citizens from paying attention to the comet. Considering the spectacular leads, incredible comedy, and relevance, this film deserves 4.6 stars.</p>
